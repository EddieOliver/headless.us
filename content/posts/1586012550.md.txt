excerpt: >-
 Like all Frontline documentaries, Amazon Empire, a yearlong effort with fifty-seven on-record interviews, is a stellar investigation of labor malpractice, antitrust issues, and the growing privacy and data security concerns over Amazon’s Alexa and Ring products. But it is also a curated experience—a critical exposé of a monopolistic behemoth whose appeals to economic wisdom are treated as the devil’s due.

The PBS Frontline documentary about Amazon and Jeff Bezos is thorough, conveyw contradictions and overlooks some imporant larger issues. Recommended.
